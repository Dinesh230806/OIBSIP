Project Title
BMI Calculator – A Simple App to Track Your Health

Description
This is a basic desktop app made using Python and Tkinter. It lets users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their height and weight. After calculating, it shows whether the user is underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. It also gives a few health tips based on the result.
